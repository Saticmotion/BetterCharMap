# BetterCharMap

BetterCharMap is a better version of Windows' Character Map. BetterCharMap works similar to the Emoji Panel (Ctrl+. or Ctrl+;) that has been included since Windows 10.

You can bring up BetterCharMap with Ctrl+F10. Begin typing to find any Unicode character. Press Enter to paste the character. Press Esc to hide BetterCharMap

Although BetterCharMap will remain active on your system, there is currently no way to automatically start it up.
To run it on startup, do the following:
- Place the executable in a locaiton of your choice.
- Create a shortcut
- Place the shortcut in `%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`


# TODO
- A better theme, that follows light/dark mode
- Better font support. Not all characters are supported in the default font
- Position window near the caret
- Show description of currently highlighted character
- Publish as an installer
